# The Balance Pink Tax Analysis

The `data` folder in this repository contains a CSV of prices of various personal care products marketed to men and women. This CSV was hand constrcuted by The Balance from 2022-03-09 to 2022-03-10 used for the analysis in the pink tax article. The `visualizations` folder contains CSVs of the [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) bar charts and table used in The Balance's [pink tax article](https://www.thebalance.com/pink-tax-pushes-prices-up-nearly-13-percent-study-finds-5222209).

The `methodology_screenshots` folder contains all the PNG screenshots referenced in the pink tax article methodology.


# Methodology

For this project, The Balance drew inspiration from the 2015 report “[From Cradle to Cane: The Cost of Being a Female Consumer](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf)” published by the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs (now NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection). This report detailed differences between consumer prices for goods marketed to men and women in five different industries: Toys and accessories, children’s clothing, adult clothing, personal care products, and senior/home health care products. The Balance’s analysis only examines differences in the category of personal care products, which the DCA’s analysis demonstrated to show the greatest disparity between products marketed to men and women. The Balance chose this product category to limit the scope of the research, while exploring differences in an area with broad applicability to daily life and with high necessity of use. 

The Balance’s analysis included the same personal care products as included in the NYC DCA analysis: Body wash, deodorant, hair care, lotion, razors, razor cartridges, and shaving cream. While many of the specific products captured were the very same or similar those analyzed in the NYC DCA report, there were a number that are either no longer in production, or no longer carried by retailers included in The Balance’s analysis. In light of this difference, no change through time should be attributed to the NYC DCA’s results and The Balance’s results.

The Balance’s analysis looked at 64 products marketed to men and 64 products marketed to women for a total of 128 products from four major retailers. Retailers included in the analysis were CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and Rite Aid. These retailers were chosen based on their representing majority of both the market of [Rx sales in drug stores](https://www.statista.com/statistics/254975/leading-20-drug-store-chains-in-the-us-based-on-rx-sales/) and also the [number of pharmacies in the US](https://www.onekeydata.com/downloads/reports/IQVIA_Report_US_Pharmacy_Market_Report_2019.pdf). More information on the product type and retailer breakdown can be found in the summary chart [here](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ozVNi/2/).

Products were chosen in order to make as close a comparison as possible between those marketed to men/women. Comparisons between gender-marketed products from the same brand or parent company were only made between products sold by the same retailers, with as similar as possible active ingredients, and product size (i.e. ounce bottle of shampoo or number of razor cartridge refill). A product’s marketed gender was either determined by how the retailer classified the product on their site<sup>1a-1d</sup> or determination of research based on product characteristics. Again the full dataset of each product name, brand, category, retailer, determined gender, size/count, price, unit price, url, and active ingredient list can be found in the `data` folder.

To ensure consistency and mitigate the price effects of promotions based on the season or the researcher's browser information<sup>2a-2d</sup>, only “original” prices were captured from each retailer. Furthermore, to ensure prices were not being dynamically set based on browser information, prices for a product were checked among online retailers with retail stores set to different locations (Brooklyn, NY and Wichita, KS), along with a browser without a VPN (Brooklyn, NY), with a [VPN](https://www.ivpn.net/) (Salt Lake City, UT), and the [Tor-browser](https://www.torproject.org/)<sup>3a-3e</sup>. As noted on several of the retailer’s websites<sup>4a-4b</sup>, prices may vary between online and in-store for certain products. As such, this data will not point to regional differences in pricing and was only collected to provide a general pricing picture nationally with regards to gendered price mark-ups. Lastly, for products analyzed from Walmart’s online store, only products that were sold by walmart.com and not third-party vendors on Walmart’s online store platform were included.
